**Data Science** is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.

**Data science** combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organizationâ€™s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.

**Data Analytics** can be described as the process of using data to answer questions, identify trends and extract insights.

- Select visualizationsd that represent the data
- Use templates to reduce time and complexity

### The four V's of big data

**Veracity** - This is the process of preventing inaccurate data from spoiling the dataset. The characteristics that reflects the accuracy of data being collected.

**Velocity** describe the rate at which the data is generated

**Variety** describe the many forms data can take - Most in a ready statefor processing and analysis eg. videos, pictures

**Volume** describes the amount of data transported and stored
